//Purpose: This is a sample program that will print the  
// number of peas in a given number of pods. 
// Input: number of pods, number of peas 
// Process: simple multiplication 
// Output: result of multiplying provided numbers 
// Example: number of pods: 2, number of peas: 6, result: 12

#include <iostream>

  do {

  //explain code
  cout << endl << endl << endl;
  cout << "This will calculate the total number of peas in the pods.";
  cout << endl << endl;

  //input
  cout << "How many pods?";
  cin >> pods;
  cout << "How many peas in each pod?";
  cin >> peas;

  //calculation
  totalPeas = pods * peas;

  //output
  cout << endl << endl;
  cout << "If you have " << pods << " pods each containing " << endl;
  cout << peas << " peas then you have a total of " << totalPeas << " peas." << endl;
